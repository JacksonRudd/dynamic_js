# Ability to solve 2d differential Equations

    ## Add Real Update
    - use time delta
    - allow reset of points 
    - allow reset of time

    ## User can change the screens on the board
    - click and add point 
    - add random points in view

    ## User input of F
    - including possibility of stockastic additions
    - should it be typescript? Or a latex script?

    ## Implement F in mathematical notation
    - Latex formatting 
    - small transpiler

    ## Show t on the sceen 
    - Ability to slow down or speed up t

# Ability to solve higher dim diffy Q's

    ## Multiple screens observing same system
    - user creates a multidemensional system 
    - specifies which coordinates to view on what axis

    ## Make Real Numbers and interface
    So it can be a view of a vector 

# Stochastics

    ## Stochastic difference equations? 

    ## Discrete Time Systems with Frames per second

# More Accurate Solution of Diffy Q

    ## Possible add different event loops for animation and update

    ## Better Update Algo Khun Tucker

# Implement Physics 
    - Points can attract each other
