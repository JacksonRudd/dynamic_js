# Ability to solve 2d differential Equations
    ## User can change the screens on the board
    - click and add point 
    - add random points in view
    
    ## View can be set before the visualistion

    ## Add Real Update
    - allow reset of points 
    - allow reset of time
    
    ## Show t on the sceen 
    - Ability to slow down or speed up t

# Break up 'Get Draw' function

# Ability to solve higher dim diffy Q's

    ## Multiple screens observing same system
    - user creates a multidemensional system 
    - specifies which coordinates to view on what axis

    ## Make Real Numbers and interface
    So it can be a view of a vector 

# Stochastics

    ## Stochastic difference equations? 

    ## Discrete Time Systems with Frames per second

# More Accurate Solution of Diffy Q

    ## Possible add different event loops for animation and update

    ## Better Update Algo Khun Tucker

# Implement Physics 
    - Points can attract each other

# Efficient Visauals
    - use a Q tree to only display points I need

# Bug: time delta becomes large when you navigate away from the page, which causes the points to explode.
